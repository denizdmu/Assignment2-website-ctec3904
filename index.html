    <p>
     The Boss 429 (also known as the "Boss 9" by enthusiasts) is arguably one of the rarest and most valued muscle cars to date. [1] In total there were 1358 original Boss 429s made. The origin of the Boss 429 came about as a result of NASCAR. Ford was seeking to develop a Hemi engine that could compete with the famed 426 Hemi from Chrysler in NASCAR's Sprint Cup Series (then known as "Grand National Division"). NASCAR's homologation rules required that at least 500 cars be fitted with this motor and sold to the general public. After much consideration, it was decided by Ford that the Mustang would be the car that would house this new engine.

    <p>The Legend, the 250 GTO, 'Gran Turismo Omologata' is the badge that lifts any Ferrari to another level. Often considered the greatest Ferrari of all time, the 250 GTO was built for endurance racing coming from a rich family line of Ferrari 250's. The 250 GTO remained one of the last front engined cars to be competitive at high level racing, eventually surcumbing to obsolescence in the mid 60's.

    Only 39 cars were built between 1962 and 1964, all by hand at the Ferrari factory in Maranello. 33 of those were the 1962-63 Series I body with a further three built as the Series II and another three as the '330 GTO' special with a larger engine. The rarity and history of the 250 GTO mark it as the most highly sort after Ferraris, and one of the most valuable cars in the world.

  Often billed as the “most famous car in the world”, James Bond’s gadget laden Silver Birch DB5 in Goldfinger became many a schoolboy’s dream. Regarded by many as the most beautiful Aston Martin produced, the DB5 shares many similar traits to the DB4. However, DB5’s most substantial change occurred under the bonnet.

The engine capacity was enlarged to 4 litres by increasing the bore to 96mm. The car had three SU carburettors, as fitted to the outgoing DB4 Vantage, and also shared the latter’s fared in headlamps. Significant too was the introduction of a full synchromesh ZF 5 speed gearbox.
